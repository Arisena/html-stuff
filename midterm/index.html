			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Brendan McCourt, and I am a student at the State Technical College of Missouri. I am currently enroller in Networking Systems Technology program and plan on most likely going to a job as an IT helpdesk.</p>
			<p>I was raised in a small town called New London in Missouri. I graduated in 2018 at Mark Twain High School in Center, Missouri. During that time I always had a great interest in computers and gaming. It came down to choosing programming to make games and computer repair, and in the end I chose NST since I enjoyed handling computer repairs and working as an IT helpdesk more than programming which I still do in my offtime, but it's not my prefered job to do.</p>
