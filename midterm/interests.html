		<h4>My Program : Networking Systems Technology (NST)</h4>
		<img src="images/cisco.png" alt="networking" class="desktop">
		<p>My program at Missouri State Tech is Networking Systems Technology, a program all about computers and computer networks. In this program it is a lot of information on how to set up computer networks, with a lot of the equipment we work on being Cisco based. It has been what I was hoping for so far.</p>
		<aside>I got my first computer at the age of 15, it was an old one that I had to do a few repairs on from time to time, and that is where I got my interest in computers and fixing them.</aside>

		<h4>Hobby : Gaming</h4>
		<img src="images" alt="gaming" class="desktop">
		<p>One of my favorite things to do in my off time is gaming. I use it as an outlit for my creativity, making characters and writing a backstory, and then setting off in whatever game it is at the time.</p>
		<p>I started on an PS2 when I was 6 years old, and it is still my favorite console to this day. Though nowadays I have moved more towards computer games, with a Nintendo switch for my offtime</p>

		<h4>Favorite Game : God Eater 3</h4>
		<img src="images/god-eater-3.png" alt="favorite" class="desktop">
		<p>My favorite game is God Eater 3</p>
		<p>It is a action role playing game where the goal is to kill giant monsters known as Aragami, it takes place in a future were humanity was nearly wipred out by said Aragami and live in small cities spread across the world run my Fenrir. The main plot is the fight against the Aragami and the Ashlands that are expanding to take more of the planet. The Ashland is a deadly area that slowly expands and is toxic for anyone to live in. The game has you trying to survive and gain your freedom, since you are not only a God Eater, you are an Adaptive God Eaterm, or AGE for short, which in the eyes of most means you are less than human.</p>
